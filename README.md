# Credit Scoring
### The dataset available is information on individual borrowers who have gone or not gone into default (i.e., have active arrears) during the study period.

### Two samples are available:
- train for model training;
 - test for the final estimation of the model.

### The target attribute is customer default: 1 - the customer was in default at the time of data collection, 0 - the customer was not in default at the time of data collection.

## Task:

1. Familiarize yourself with the data, conduct EDA, draw conclusions about the data we are working with: how it is distributed, what attributes affect the target attribute.
2. Perform modeling using the following models: logistic regression, random forest, bousting.  Optimize the hyperparameters.
